<section class="about">

  <h3>Where It All Began</h3>

  <p>
    ABC Fitness Studio was founded in Las Vegas, Nevada, with humble beginnings inside a small garage. What started as a passion project quickly grew into a community-driven fitness studio dedicated to helping people transform their lives through strength, discipline, and consistency.
  </p>

  <p>
    The founder began training friends and neighbors in the garage, using basic equipment and a strong commitment to helping others achieve their goals. Word quickly spread throughout the Las Vegas community, and ABC Fitness Studio became known for its welcoming environment and effective training programs.
